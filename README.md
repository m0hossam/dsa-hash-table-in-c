# Hash Table Implementation In C

This is a simple implementation of the hash-table data structure in C, using linked lists & separate chaining for collision handling. I created this project to practice my humble knowledge of data structures & algorithms and the C programming language.

### Project Specifications
- The hash table stores string only key-value pairs
- The hash table has a max size of 53 pairs
- Collision handling is done using the separate chaining technique
- The separate chaining technique is implemented using a singly linked list

### Credits
- James Routley's [write-a-hash-table](https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table) tutorial
  - This tutorial explained the underlying mechanism of hash-tables & double-hashing clearly, a significant part of my code is similar to the tutorial's code.
- Stack Overflow & the internet in general
  - Various late nights spent googling errors can attest.
- Some Books
  - Data Structures & Algorithms in Java by Robert Lafore helped me with the linked list, while the C Programming Language helped me with pointers.
